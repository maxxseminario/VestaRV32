	// TODO: NOTE: WARNING: This was changed from the previous versions! It used to be that SMCLK would be sourced by LFXT (at 32.768 kHz) to give a baud of 2048. However, to ensure compatibility with all Linux/Windows/macOS serial port drivers, this has been changed to a standard baudrate of 115200. This will prevent a lot of issues down the road with driver support. However, the main drawback is that it assumes HFXT will be exactly 24 MHz to produce the correct baud. Fortunately, if you do use a different frequency for HFXT, most off-the-shelf oscillators give a frequency that will still produce a standard baud using this same hard-coded setting for UART0BR. For example, if HFXT is 16 MHz, the baud would become 76800, a standard baud. A non-exhaustive list of valid HFXT frequencies: 62.5 kHz, 125 kHz, 250 kHz, 375 kHz, 500 kHz, 1 MHz, 1.5 MHz, 2 MHz, 3 MHz, 4 MHz, 6 MHz, 8 MHz, 12 MHz, 16 MHz, 24 MHz, 32 MHz, 48 MHz, 96 MHz.
