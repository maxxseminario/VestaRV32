                Reasons for remaining drv violations
=======================================================================
*info: Total 94 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because the net has unplaced term or invalid term for routing.

*info: Total 12 net(s) were new nets created by previous iteration of DRV buffering. Further DRV fixing might remove some violations.

*info: Total 40 net(s) have violations which can't be fixed by DRV optimization.

MultiBuffering failure reasons
------------------------------------------------
*info:     7 net(s): Could not be fixed because the gain is not enough.
*info:    32 net(s): Could not be fixed because the net has unplaced term or invalid term for routing.

### UNL STATUS #### : Writing SDF file
<CMD> write_sdf $OUTPUT_DIR/$DESIGN_NAME.sdf
**WARN: (SDF-808):	The software is currently operating in a high performance mode which optimizes the handling of multiple timing arcs between input and output pin pairs. With the current settings, the SDF file generated will contain the same delay information for all of these arcs. To have the SDF recalculated with explicit pin pair data, you should use the option '-recompute_delay_calc'. This setting is recommended for generating SDF for functional  simulation applications.
