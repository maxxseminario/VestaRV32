# VestaRV - A Custom RISC-V Core and Complete MCU

VestaRV is a custom RISC-V processor core designed entirely in-house, built from the official RISC-V instruction set specification without deriving from any existing core implementations. This repository not only provides the VestaRV core but also a full MCU subsystem that surrounds the core, enabling rapid integration into embedded and SoC designs.

## Interrupt Handling

- **Stack-based mechanism** enables recursive interrupt handling
- **Caution:** Recursive interrupts may lead to stack overflow if not managed

## Building and Toolchain

Toolchains (gcc, binutils, etc.) can be obtained via the [RISC-V Website](https://riscv.org/software-status/). Example programs expect various RV32 toolchains installed in `/opt/riscv32i[m][c]`. Many Linux distributions now include RISC-V tools (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04 provides `gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf`). Set `TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX` accordingly for your environment (e.g., `make TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=riscv64-unknown-elf`).

## Evaluation and Synthesis Results

Results for timing, resource utilization, and physical verification (Innovus) are provided for supported FPGAs and ASIC flows. Refer to the `results/` or documentation folders for details.
