WARNING (XSTRM-174): The target library is already attached to technology library `tsmcN65'. Therefore, 'techRefs' option will be ignored
WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'washakie' is attached to the technology library 'tsmcN65'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
