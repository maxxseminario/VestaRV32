INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, strmin/gds2cds.map
WARNING (XSTRM-38): The library sram1p1k_hvt_pg in the refLibList file strmin/reflib.list could not be found. This is because the library 'sram1p1k_hvt_pg' specified in refLibList file does not exist. Ensure that the library 'sram1p1k_hvt_pg' is defined in the library definition file and also exists in the location specified in the library definition file.

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
