INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
