Warning : Library cell has no output pins defined. [LBR-9]
        : Library cell 'FILL18CAP128A10TH' must have an output pin.
        : Add the missing output pin(s), then reload the library. Else the library cell will be marked as timing model i.e. unusable. Timing_model means that the cell does not have any defined function. If there is no output pin, Genus will mark library cell as unusable i.e. the attribute 'usable' will be marked to 'false' on the libcell. Therefore, the cell is not used for mapping and it will not be picked up from the library for synthesis. If you query the attribute 'unusable_reason' on the libcell; result will be: 'Library cell has no output pins.'Note: The message LBR-9 is only for the logical pins and not for the power_ground pins. Genus will depend upon the output function defined in the pin group (output pin) of the cell, to use it for mapping. The pg_pin will not have any function defined.

Warning : Relaxing an attribute value in the library. [LBR-39]
        : Overriding the avoid (ie. dont_use) attribute for library-cell 'TIEHIX1MA10TH'.
        : Relaxing one of the library's attribute value (for example, a library-cell's dont_use or dont_touch attribute) should be done with caution. This warning means that a dont_use or dont_touch attribute defined for a library cell (in liberty file) is overridden by the user in the run. When you do 'read_cpf -library' in a CPF based flow, apart from loading libraries, this command automatically marks low power standard cells as usable. So that the synthesis can use them. These low power standard cells are usually marked 'dont_use true' in the liberty. That's why when the tool makes them usable (avoid = false), these warnings are flagged.

        VHDL 'foo' (in any library) replaces  Verilog {'FOO' or 'foo' or 'Foo' or ...} in the same library
 
A newly read Verilog module replaces any previously read Verilog module if its name matches (case-sensitively) that module.  Further, it replaces any previously read VHDL entity in the same library if its name matches (case -insensitively) that entity.
    For instance:
        Verilog 'foo' replaces    VHDL {'FOO' or 'foo' or 'Foo' or ...} in the same library
        Verilog 'foo' replaces    Verilog 'foo' only
    In addition:
        Verilog 'foo' does not replace Verilog 'FOO' and the two remain as distinct modules.

Scan mapping status report
==========================
    Scan mapping: converting flip-flops that pass TDRC.
    Scan mapping: bypassed.  You have to either 1) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'tdrc_pass' and run 'check_dft_rules' or 2) set attribute 'dft_scan_map_mode' to 'force_all'.

    Scan mapping bypassed because no TDRC data is available: either command 'check_dft_rules' has not been run or TDRC data has been subsequently invalidated.
